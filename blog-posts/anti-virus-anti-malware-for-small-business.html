                        <article>
                            <p>When looking for anti-virus/anti-malware software for small businesses, there are things to consider to make sure you are not overpaying for things you don't need or missing features that you <em>do</em> need.</p>

                            <h2>End Point Security System</h2>
                            <p>Your business may only have five computers, but they still need to have some sort of security system in place to protect your <em>and</em> your customers' data. It is also important to keep apps and programs up to date, especially security patch, to avoid exposing yourself to any new potentially harmful virus or malware.</p>

                            <p>It is also important to know the common safety measurement guidelines when handling sensitive data to avoid damage caused by human error. For example, you may want to use different passwords for different accounts or changing your passwords periodically. And, passwords are meant to be secret and known only by people meant to have access to them.</p>

                            <p>The minimum standard for small business is to have an end point security system in place for all workstations. This would give a sufficient protection against the everyday threats when people are doing their daily businesses. This may include web protection, ransomware protection, etc.</p>

                            <p>Proper security is expensive and at the cost of convenience. However, security software companies today offer individuals and small businesses end point security systems that are reasonably priced if you know which ones to look at.</p>

                            <h2>Choosing Brand</h2>
                            <p>When choosing a brand for your end protection system, you may want to consider your company size (i.e., how many workstations, how many users, how big and how much value the data would have, etc.), the nature of your business operation in terms of system access (i.e., internal use only, high traffic of guest users, etc.), and sensitivity of data (i.e., personal details, payment details, health records, etc.). Another thing that you may want to consider is when you have different operating systems (i.e., Windows and Mac) in place, you might want to look for solutions that could handle protection for both operating systems.</p>

                            <p>McAfee, Symantec, Sophos are great options when your business is medium to large. You would need to contact the respective provider to know their pricing. In terms of protection and customer support here in Australia, these companies are good. These brand would also be suitable for small businesses who handle large or sensitive data, and would need consultant who can come in person to your premises to help you with any security issues.</p>

                            <p>For other small businesses, you can check Bitdefender and Malwarebytes for your end point protection. Avast was good until they started to <em>regularly</em> and <em>persistently</em> install their browser automatically in my system, prompting me having to remove it every now and then.</p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>If you are a small business that doesn't handle much sensitive data, has relatively small team member and restricted access to internal system, or you have IT professionals working in-house, you may want to consider Bitdefender and Malwarebytes.</p>
                            
                            <p>Otherwise, if you are a small business that handles sensitive customers' data in a large scale, has complicated business operations involving multiple third parties needing access to different parts of your system, and/or medium or large business (turnover more than $10 million as per ATO definition on Dec 2020), you may need to speak to a security consultant to check which security system would suit your business.</p>
