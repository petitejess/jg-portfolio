                            <p>A guide to maximise productivity when you work from home. This time, I will guide you through setting up your workstation, choosing the right gears and software for your home office, with little tips and tricks to maximise comfort.</p>
    
                            <h2>Physical Setup</h2>
                            <p>Our goal is to create a space in our home where we could keep our motivation high. A proper setup is important as it would affect our physical being, which related to our mental state. The bed is not a comfortable place to work with a laptop.</p>

                            <h3>Comfortable Furniture</h3>
                            <p>A stable desk at proper height and enough space to put your stuff, a padded adjustable ergonomic chair, proper lighting, and a good coffee machine would be our basic needs when setting up our workstation. Well, maybe the good coffee machine is a luxury, but the other things are essentials.</p>
        
                            <h3>Ergonomic Accessories</h3>
                            <p>Next things we want to check to complete our setup are accessories, such as keyboard, mouse, and mouse pad. We might also want to consider monitor or laptop stand to help keeping our head straight when looking at the monitor. This is important to avoid hurting your neck when you need to stare at the monitor for the whole day.</p>
                            <p>A web cam, if not using device with built-in cams, is also something we want to consider just in case we need to suddenly hold a virtual meeting. A camera using your phone setup on a stand is fine for a video call less than 45 minutes long, but longer than that, we would risk damaging our phone for overheating. And no, I strongly against charging and video calling at the same time because charging would bring the temperature even higher.</p>

                            <h3>Good Posture</h3>
                            <p>Good posture is as important as comfortable furniture. Sit straight with your feet flat touching the floor and your elbow should be at a 90 to 110 degrees. The top of your monitor should be at your eye-level so that your neck is straight. This is where the monitor/laptop stand comes in handy.</p>

                            <h2>Software and Tools</h2>
                            <p>Now that we have our workstation ready, we need to make sure we have the software and tools to help us get on top of our work.</p>

                            <h3>Internet Connection</h3>
                            <p>If latency is crucial, I suggest using a good quality ethernet cable. Otherwise, wi-fi would be fine. Make sure your ethernet cable is properly placed and secured to avoid tripping hazard. For wi-fi user, if the signal is weak, you can get a wi-fi booster/extender.</p>

                            <h3>Security</h3>
                            <p>It is important that your Firewall, Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware software are up to date and running. And, it is strongly recommended to have at least one form of additional protection in addition to the one that usually comes with your operating system. Also, make sure to keep all software and operating system up to date to avoid exploitations.</p>

                            <h3>Remote Access</h3>
                            <p>If your work requires you to keep your work files in office computer, you might want to ask your IT team to setup a permission for remote access. Or if you are the IT guy, you probably already set your own. Just remember to stick to the IT policies.</p>

                            <h3>Cloud Storage and Online Management Tools</h3>
                            <p>Set up a sharable cloud storage, or simply use online document processor to easily work collaboratively in your team. Manage tasks between team members using online management tools.</p>

                            <h2>Regular Breaks</h2>
                            <p>It is good habit to rest at certain intervals throughout the day. Not only your usual breaks at lunch, coffee or toilet breaks, but also micro-breaks that you need to maintain throughout the day.</p>

                            <h3>Keep Hydrated</h3>
                            <p>Do not forget to drink your water throughout the day. Your body will thank you.</p>

                            <h3>Eye Rest</h3>
                            <p>You should look away from your monitor for every 20 minutes. Just a few second away from staring at your screen would do good for your precious eyes.</p>

                            <h3>Stretching</h3>
                            <p>Remember to stretch your wrist and fingers for every 15 minutes of typing streak to avoid developing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.</p>

                            <h3>Moving</h3>
                            <p>Walking away from keyboards, tip-toeing and circling ankles every now and then to pump blood from your legs would reduce risks of developing Deep Vein Thrombosis.</p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>We now have the basics to start working from home. We now want to check our local shop for a good coffee machineâ€¦</p>
